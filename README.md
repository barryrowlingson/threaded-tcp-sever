Python TCP Threaded Server
==========================

A threaded TCP server written in Python using PySide. This code is meant to be modified/extended in order to meet a specific requirement.
If you ever needed a TCP server that can handle multiple clients separately, just grab this sources and own them. Needless to say, it can be easily modified to support UDP using the QUdpSocket class.
